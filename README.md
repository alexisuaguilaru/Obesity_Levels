# Obesity Levels
This project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model to estimate obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition.

# Dataset Overview
[1] This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.

# Project Overview
For the creation of this model, firstly was performed a feature selection using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Gain Information (GI) based on [2] in order to improve model's accuracy.
